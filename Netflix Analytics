SELECT max (date(date_added)) from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech". "netflix_titles_info"

SELECT title from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech". "netflix_titles_info" 
Order by title asc;

ORDER by release_year asc
LIMIT 1;

#6. Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, 
their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”. 

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)

Select artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' as tag 
from popularity_average_CTE
Where average_popularity>=90;
