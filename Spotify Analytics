# For this project, I was asked to download Spotify data from Kaggle. 
#Then I was asked to create a table to insert Spotity data into. 
#Finaly, I decided to perform analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)
#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

# First I ranked the artists by popularity. 
 SELECT artist_name, danceability, popularity 
 FROM Bit_DB.Spotifydata
 Order by popularity asc;
 
 #Then I determined the average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
 SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg (danceability), avg(energy), avg (popularity)
 FROM Bit_DB.Spotifydata
Group by artist_name, track_name

#Last but not least, I determine the top 5 most popular artists
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM Bit_DB.Spotifydata
Order by popularity desc
Limit 5
